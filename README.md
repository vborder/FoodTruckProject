## FoodTruck Application - Week 2 Skill Distillery

### Overview
The project is a food truck app designed to:

- allow a user to input up to 5 food trucks with name, food type, and rating info;
- allow a user to enter "quit" before entering five trucks and proceed to an app menu;
- allow a user to select from a menu of options to:
	(1) list all of the entered food trucks; 
	(2) see the average rating of the food trucks; 
	(3) display the highest rated food truck; and 
	(4) quit the program.
- the program assigns a unique ID to each food truck;
- allow a user to infinitely select from the menu until choosing to quit the program. 

### Technologies Used
- Eclipse
- Java
- GitHub/Git

### Lessons Learned
- Main methods can be very small
- If conditions in for loops can prevent null pointer errors when iterating through reference arrays
- A counter can be used to account for an array's "filled" memory locations, and then used to perform calculations on data (average of food truck rating, in this project)
- the toString() method is very useful for returning a String representing all of the items stored in an array object
